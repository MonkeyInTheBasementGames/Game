Plan:

Game Idea 1:
Platformer:
Would have super marioesque art style (the old pixelly ones)
Special game mechanic:
Players would  have a limited number of lives which would vary from level to level, when a player dies a block would be spawned in the place 
of their dead body. The player could then use this block to jump off of. Levels would be designed so that players would have to plan  where
they would want to die. This game would require a lot of skill in the later levels because players would have to repeat jumps multiple times
in order to get to a spot where they could make further progress through the map, this process would then have to be repeated multiple times.
